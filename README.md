# Variational Learning of Compressed and Error-Mitigated Quantum States of Classical Data

This repository contains the implementation of the state preparation method described in the article "Variational Learning of Compressed and Error-Mitigated Quantum States of Classical Data". It also includes a test suite to assess the reproducibility of the results presented in the corresponding paper.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
conda create --name var_learning_ceqc --file requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the test suit:

```
python3 ./launch_tests.py
```
